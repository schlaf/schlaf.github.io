If the warjack is in range, take control of it and remove this model from the table. Effects on this model when it is removed from the table expire. You cannot activate the warjack this turn. 

If the melded warjack was part of a battlegroup, while it is in its former controller's control area during the former controller's activation the former controller can spend focus points to attempt to regain control of it at 1 focus point per attempt. If it does so, the former controller and this model each roll a d6 and add their CMD. If the former controller's total is higher, it regains control of the warjack and this model exits the warjack. If the former controller's total is not higher, you maintain control of the warjack. 

After resolving an attack in which the melded warjack suffered 1 or more damage points, this model must make a command check. If it fails this check, it exits the warjack after resolving continuous effects during your next Maintenance Phase. You can choose to have this model exit the warjack after resolving continuous effects during your Maintenance Phase. 
If this model exits the warjack for any reason, control of the warjack returns its former controller. Place this model within 3" of the warjack. If the warjack was inert when this model melded with it, the warjack becomes autonomous.

This model is destroyed if the melded warjack is destroyed before it exits the warjack.</capacity>
